Aliases means creating shortcuts or keywords for existing commands. Suppose if we wanted to execute the below
command which is nothing but the directory listing command with the /W option to not show all of the necessay
detail in a directory listing.
dir /w

Suppose if we want to exxcute the 'dir /w' command, we can simply type in the word 'dw'.
The word 'dw' has now become an alias to the command 'dir /w'

Creating an alias
Alias are managed by using the 'doskey' command.
Syntax:
doskey [option] [macro-name = [test]]
wherein
	- macro-name: A short name for the macro
	- The commands you wnat to recall

@echo off

By default, a batch file will display its command as it runs. Ithe purpose of this first command is to turn off
this dispaly. The command "echo off" turns off the display for the whole script, except for the "ehco off" command
itself. The "at" sing "@" in front makes the command aplly to itself as well.

Documentation
Very often batch files also contains lines that start with the "Rem" command. This is a way to enter comments and
documentation. The computer ignoress anything on a line following Rem. For batc files with increasing amount of complexity, this is often a good idea to have comments.

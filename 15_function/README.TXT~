A funtion is a set of statement organized together to perform a specific task.
In the batch scripts, a similar approch is adopted to group logical statements
together to from a function.
As like any other languages, functions in batch script follows the same procedure:
   * Function Declaration: it tell compiler about a function's' name, return type
   and parameters.
   * Function Definition: It provides the actual body of the function.

	Function Defintion
In batch script, a function is defined by using the label statement. When a funcion
is newly defined, it may take one or severl value as input 'paramenters' to the __
function, process the function is the main body, and pass back the values to the _
functions as output 'return types'.
